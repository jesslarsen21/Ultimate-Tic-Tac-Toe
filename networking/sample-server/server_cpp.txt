class Server:
	class clientConnection:
		declared inside server class
	server init function will be the server constructor
	use some container for client connections - set, map, vector
	basically remake all functions in the current server as methods of the class;
		keep functionality the same
	create add client method
	handle_client method, passed the reference to the client, handles the echo
	these 2 methods are to shorten and modularize the main loop

don't have any structs
on success return 0, for fail return -1
